Perform testing of hypothesis using Z-test. Use a Z test if:
• Your sample size is greater than 30. Otherwise, use a t test.
• Data points should be independent from each other. In other words, one data point
isn’t related or doesn’t affect another data point.
• Your data should be normally distributed. However, for large sample sizes (over
30) this doesn’t always matter.
• Your data should be randomly selected from a population, where each item has
an equal chance of being selected.
• Sample sizes should be equal if at all possible.
Ho - Blood pressure has a mean of 156 units
Program Code for one-sample Z test.
from statsmodels.stats import weightstats as stests
import pandas as pd
from scipy import stats
df = pd.read_csv("blood_pressure.csv")
df[['bp_before','bp_after']].describe()
print(df)
ztest ,pval = stests.ztest(df['bp_before'], x2=None, value=156)
print(float(pval))
if pval<0.05:
 print("reject null hypothesis")
else:
 print("accept null hypothesis")
Output:
